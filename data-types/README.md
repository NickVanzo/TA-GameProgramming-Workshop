# C++ Data Types Workshop

## Overview

This workshop is designed to provide an introduction to the fundamental data types in C++. Understanding these data types is essential for mastering C++ programming. In this session, you'll explore various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, strings, and enums. You'll also learn about type casting and the difference between traditional enums and scoped enums.

## Workshop Agenda

1. **Introduction to C++ Data Types**
   - Explanation of basic data types.
   - Importance of data types in programming.

2. **Hands-On Examples**
   - **Integers:** Learn about `int`, `short int`, `long int`, and `long long int`.
   - **Floating-Point Numbers:** Explore `float`, `double`, and `long double`.
   - **Characters and Strings:** Understand `char` and `std::string`.
   - **Booleans:** Work with `bool` for true/false values.
   - **Enums:** Learn about traditional and scoped enums.
   - **Type Casting:** See how to perform implicit and explicit type conversions.

3. **Q&A Session**
   - Address any questions or challenges encountered during the workshop.

## Code Overview

### Integers

- **`int`**: Default integer type, usually 4 bytes.
- **`short int`**: Smaller integer, typically 2 bytes.
- **`long int`**: Larger integer, typically 4 or 8 bytes.
- **`long long int`**: Very large integer, typically 8 bytes.

### Floating-Point Numbers

- **`float`**: Single-precision floating-point, typically 4 bytes.
- **`double`**: Double-precision floating-point, typically 8 bytes.
- **`long double`**: Extended precision floating-point, typically 10 or 16 bytes.

### Characters and Strings

- **`char`**: Represents single characters.
- **`std::string`**: Represents sequences of characters.

### Booleans

- **`bool`**: Represents true or false values.

### Enums

- **Traditional `enum`**: A user-defined type consisting of a set of named integral constants.
- **Scoped `enum class`**: Provides stronger type safety and clarity compared to traditional enums.

### Type Casting

- **Implicit Cast**: Automatic type conversion performed by the compiler.
- **Explicit Cast**: Type conversion explicitly requested by the programmer using `static_cast`.
