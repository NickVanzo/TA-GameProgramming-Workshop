# C++ Workshop Series

## Introduction

Welcome to the **C++ Workshop Series**! This collection of code examples is designed to guide you through various important topics in C++ programming. Each workshop focuses on a specific aspect of the language, providing hands-on examples and practical exercises to help you build a solid foundation in C++.

### Workshop Topics

1. **C++ Data Types**
   - Introduction to fundamental data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, and strings.
   - Understanding type casting and the use of enums. 

2. **Data Structures in C++**
   - Explore essential data structures like arrays, vectors, sets, and unordered maps.
   - Learn how to use custom classes with standard C++ containers.

3. **Control Flow and Loops**
   - Deep dive into control flow statements and loops.

4. **Functions and Recursion**
   - Understanding function declaration, definition, and usage.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming in C++**
   - Principles of object-oriented programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance. 

## Navigating the Folders

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different workshop topic. Hereâ€™s how to navigate through them:

- **`cpp-intro/`**: A simple "hello world" example to get acquainted with the g++ compiler. 
- **`data-types/`**: Contains examples related to C++ data types, type casting, and enums.
- **`data-structures/`**: Contains examples demonstrating the use of arrays, vectors, sets, and unordered maps.
- **`classes/`**: Explores object-oriented programming concepts with practical C++ examples.

Each folder contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions and explanations for the examples in that topic.

## Prerequisites

To follow along this workshop, you'll need the following:

### C++ Compiler

You need a C++ compiler such as `g++` to compile and run the examples. Below are instructions for installing `g++` on different operating systems:

- **Windows:**
  1. Download and install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).
  2. Ensure that `g++` is added to your system's PATH during installation.
  3. Open the Command Prompt and type `g++ --version` to verify the installation.

- **macOS:**
  1. Open Terminal.
  2. Install Xcode Command Line Tools by typing:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```
  3. Verify the installation by typing `g++ --version` in the Terminal.

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based):**
  1. Open Terminal.
  2. Install `g++` by typing:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install g++
     ```
  3. Verify the installation by typing `g++ --version` in the Terminal.

### Text Editor or IDE

You can use any text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. Popular options include:

- **VS Code**: [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **CLion**: [Download here](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- **Code::Blocks**: [Download here](http://www.codeblocks.org/)

## How to Run the Examples

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
