# Data Structures in C++ Workshop

## Overview

Welcome to the **Data Structures in C++** workshop! This workshop aims to provide you with a practical understanding of basic data structures in C++. We'll cover fundamental concepts and explore how to work with arrays, sets, unordered maps, and vectors. By the end of this session, you'll have hands-on experience with these data structures and understand their basic operations and use cases.

## Workshop Agenda

1. **Introduction to Data Structures**
   - Importance of Data Structures in Programming
   - Overview of Arrays, Sets, Unordered Maps, and Vectors

2. **Hands-On Examples**
   - **Arrays:** Static, fixed-size collections of elements.
   - **Sets:** Collection of unique elements with fast lookup.
   - **Unordered Maps:** Key-value pairs with fast access time.
   - **Vectors:** Dynamic arrays with the ability to resize.

3. **Q&A Session**
   - Address any questions or challenges encountered during the workshop.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C++ programming
- A C++ compiler installed on your machine
